# PRWT

Phrase Ranker With Template

This program is a simple yet powerfull text-based entry voting platform.
You can use it for very different things, few ranking ideas:
website, software, name, quotes, jokes, for now, anything that's unformated (at least for now) text based is doable!

An important note is that it uses OAuth2 and ONLY discord as of now, this is a indepedent choice, we will concider adding options in the futur.

If you have any suggestion, feel free to open an issue !
